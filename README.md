# ✨ SocialSpark

**SocialSpark** is a query-driven platform designed to ignite your social media growth by providing AI-powered insights for instagram. The platform fetches detailed social media data, including engagement metrics, audience insights, and performance analytics, using advanced APIs.

- ❓ _"What hashtags should I use for my niche?"_
